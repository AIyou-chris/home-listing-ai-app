## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### 1. **Revoke and Regenerate API Keys**
```bash
# You MUST do this immediately:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts
# 2. Generate new private key
# 3. Go to OpenAI Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
# 4. Revoke old key and create new one
# 5. Go to Google AI Studio
# 6. Revoke old Gemini key and create new one
```

### 2. **Set Production Environment Variables**
```bash
# Copy the template and fill in real values:
cp .env.production.template .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your actual API keys
```

### 3. **Update Firebase Security Rules**
```javascript
// Update Firestore security rules to be more restrictive:
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Properties can be read by authenticated users, written by owners
    match /properties/{propertyId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || 
         request.auth.token.role == 'admin');
    }
    
    // Admin-only collections
    match /admin/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### 1. **Set Up Error Tracking**
- [ ] Sign up for Sentry or similar service
- [ ] Add VITE_SENTRY_DSN to environment variables
- [ ] Configure error reporting in production

### 2. **Set Up Monitoring**
- [ ] Configure Firebase Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

### 3. **Database Security**
- [ ] Review and tighten Firestore security rules
- [ ] Set up backup policies
- [ ] Configure data retention policies

### 4. **Content Security Policy**
Add to your HTML head:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  connect-src 'self' https://api.openai.com https://*.googleapis.com;
">
```

### 5. **HTTPS and Security Headers**
Ensure your hosting platform (Firebase Hosting) has:
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (should be automatic)
- [ ] HSTS headers
- [ ] X-Frame-Options
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options

## üîß **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### Before Deploying:
- [ ] All API keys revoked and regenerated
- [ ] .env.production configured with real values
- [ ] Firebase security rules updated
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled

### After Deploying:
- [ ] Test all major functionality
- [ ] Verify admin access works correctly
- [ ] Check error tracking is receiving data
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Test with different user roles

## üìä **MONITORING SETUP**

### 1. **Firebase Console Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up alerts for authentication failures
- [ ] Monitor Firestore usage and costs
- [ ] Set up Cloud Function error alerts

### 2. **Application Monitoring**
- [ ] Monitor session duration and user engagement
- [ ] Track API response times
- [ ] Monitor error rates and types

### 3. **Security Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed admin access attempts
- [ ] Monitor unusual user activity patterns
- [ ] Track API usage for potential abuse

## üöÄ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS**

### Already Implemented:
- [x] Lazy loading for admin components
- [x] Error boundaries to prevent crashes
- [x] Performance monitoring service
- [x] Session tracking with activity monitoring

### Additional Recommendations:
- [ ] Implement service worker for caching
- [ ] Add image optimization
- [ ] Consider CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement code splitting for larger components

## üìù **REGULAR MAINTENANCE**

### Weekly:
- [ ] Review error logs and fix critical issues
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Check performance metrics

### Monthly:
- [ ] Update dependencies (security patches)
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Analyze user behavior and performance data

### Quarterly:
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery testing

## üÜò **EMERGENCY CONTACTS**

If you discover a security issue:
1. **Immediately** revoke compromised API keys
2. Check logs for unauthorized access
3. Update affected users if necessary
4. Document the incident for future prevention

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup!
